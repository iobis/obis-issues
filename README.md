# obis-issues

The OBIS Issues repo is used for capturing and tracking all types of issues that arise in the operations of OBIS, from the portal and web site to the map tool, API, R package, and other tools in the OBIS ecosystem of capabilities. OBIS issues are the responsibility of the OBIS community, including the OBIS Steering Group, OBIS Secretariat (data management and software engineering), and our community at large. Anyone can post issues and comment, and we encourage both direct contribution and capture of issues from meetings, training, and other activities.

We make use of labels on issues to help determine what kind of action is appropriate and assignments to individuals within our community who need to comment and close issues or articulate how issues need to be taken to action in engineering the system. The following guidelines should be used in creating and managing issues in this repo.
