# obis-issues

The OBIS Issues repo is used for capturing and tracking all types of issues that arise in the operations of OBIS, from the portal and web site to the map tool, API, R package, and other tools in the OBIS ecosystem of capabilities. OBIS issues are the responsibility of the OBIS community, including the OBIS Steering Group, OBIS Secretariat (data management and software engineering), and our community at large. Anyone can post issues and comment, and we encourage both direct contribution and capture of issues from meetings, training, and other activities.

We make use of labels on issues to help determine what kind of action is appropriate and assignments to individuals within our community who need to comment and close issues or articulate how issues need to be taken to action in engineering the system. The following guidelines should be used in creating and managing issues in this repo.

## Labeling

* API - Features needed in the API
* bug - Inappropriate behavior in the application indicating a bug
* data quality - Issues associated with the quality/completeness of datasets and records
* data rescue - Datasets identified for potential rescue operations
* data standards - Issues associated with the Darwin Core or other standards employed that have not yet been assigned
* duplicate - Duplicate of another issue; comment should point to the preferred issue to be resolved
* harvesting - Issues associated with the OBIS harvesting pipeline process and codebase
* mapper - Mapper.obis.org map tool
* metadata portal - metadata.obis.org application for managing internal connections
* OBIS EC - Issues that need to be addressed by the OBIS EC and passed on to appropriate assignments
* OBIS Manual - Requested documentation changes to the OBIS manual
* smalldata - smalldata.obis.org application for submitting individual records to the OBIS database
* website - Static text and informational aspects of the OBIS.org web site
